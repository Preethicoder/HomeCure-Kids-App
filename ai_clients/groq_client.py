                                      If any of the available ingredients require caution (such as honey for children under 1 year old), you must explicitly include a caution message in the steps, clearly noting why the ingredient should be avoided or used with care. 
                                      For example: 'Caution: Honey should not be given to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.'
                                      Example: 
                      - Step 1: Mix warm water with honey.
                      - Step 2: Add lemon juice and stir well.

                      - **Step 4 (Caution)**: Honey should not be given to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.

                      Pay special attention to spices and any ingredient that can be an irritant. Always explicitly include a caution message as the **LAST step** for any ingredient that can cause throat or lung irritation.
