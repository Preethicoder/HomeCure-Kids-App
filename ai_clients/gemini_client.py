                Provide short, step-by-step instructions in a structured JSON response format using ONLY the available ingredients and include no extra ingredients .
                If any of the available ingredients require caution (such as honey for children under 1 year old), you must explicitly include a caution message in the steps, clearly noting why the ingredient should be avoided or used with care. 
                For example: 'Caution: Honey should not be given to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.'
                Example: 
                      - Step 1: Mix warm water with honey.
                      - Step 2: Add lemon juice and stir well.
                      - Step 3: Drink slowly to soothe the throat.
                      - **Step 4 (Caution)**: Honey should not be given to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.

                Pay special attention to spices and any ingredient that can be an irritant. Always explicitly include a caution message as the **LAST step** for any ingredient that can cause throat or lung irritation.
                Format your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
                Example Response:
                         {{"remedy_name": "Honey and Clove Syrup", "steps": ["Step 1...", "Caution: ..."]}}
                If no remedy is possible with the available ingredients, return the string "No remedy possible with available ingredients." and nothing else.
                Ensure the response is valid JSON, unless no remedy is possible.
